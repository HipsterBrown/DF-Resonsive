Is Daring Fireball Responsive Yet?
==========

A simple site to ask one of the most important questions on the internet:
> Is Daring Fireball Responsive Yet?

Inspired by the conversation had in [Ep. 95](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2014/09/19/ep-095) of [The Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/), where John Gruber admits Daring Fireball is one of the prolific sites to go responsive after Apple recently revealed their responsive web experience.

Now Daring Fireball & The Talk Show fans have a place to check on the progress of Gruber's responsive efforts.

Please feel free to fork the site and submit pull requests for any improvements or changes you would like to see.
